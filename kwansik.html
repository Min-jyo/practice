                        I am a UX Designer and Art Director from Austria living in Berlin.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Artworks and illustrations were my gateway to the creative industry which led to the foundation
                        of my own
                        studio and to first steps in the digital world.

                    <p>
                        Starting with basic websites several years ago I found myself working as an Art Director for
                        complex
                        projects with a holistic approach soon. Visually appealing designs, subtle details and brand
                        guidelines
                        combined to innovative interfaces across various touch points became my daily companion.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Out of this love for aesthetic design my passion for functionality and structure evolved.
                        Jumping right into
                        Photoshop didn’t feel accurate anymore and skipping the steps of building a framework based on
                        functionality
                        and usability became inevitable.

                        A user-centered mindset and sensitivity for design turned out to be the perfect fit when

                            A research and concept phase which referred to an existing brand strategy set the course at
                            the beginning of this project. General use cases based on personas, information architecture
                            and detailed wireframes for the whole digital appearance followed.

                        <p>
                            This appearance was structured into modules with a limited amount of additional
                            functionalities
                            and supportive tools which build the framework for an engaging experience.

                            This approach provided a number of possibilities for the content team to setup unique pages

                            quite a challenge because of the huge amount of content that should have been neatly

                            allow multiple iteration cycles if needed.

                            Reframing a running experience required various discovery and
                            conception phases, detailed research, different user experience
                            solutions and countless scribbled wireframes. A first thought of
                            processing into a gamification direction was discarded soon
                            – a minimalistic, straight forward approach made it definite.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For example all basic elements needed for starting a run can be
                            found on the startscreen of the app. By tapping the run button
                            the next workout starts immediately which spares users to navigate
                            through run related settings.

                                One core challenge were the PUMATRAC
                                Milestones. Little badges that can be
                                achieved in various situations related to a
                                run. A framework that works for multiple
                                purposes had to be created.

                                Rough sketches outlined the design
                                process before refining each of them
                                digitally.

                    <div class="">
                        <h5>
                            The digital environment
                        </h5>
                        <p>
                            In addition to the PUMATRAC mobile app, the whole digital
                            nvironment surrounding the app had to be built.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A responsive website to promote the app, a user backend to
                            login and see runs online, a visually appealing content
                            management system for the PUMA team and various social
                            network items were on the list.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The user backend and content management system were done
                            very cleanly whereas the promotional app had much more visual
                            value. Both were built to extend at any point to emphasise new
                            features.
