                    <p>
                        I am a UX Designer and Art Director from Austria living in Berlin.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Artworks and illustrations were my gateway to the creative industry which led to the foundation
                        of my own studio and to first steps in the digital world.
                    </p>

                <div class="about-section2-work1"> Art Direction
                    <p>
                        Starting with basic websites several years ago I found myself working as an Art Director for
                        complex projects with a holistic approach soon. Visually appealing designs, subtle details and
                        brand guidelines combined to innovative interfaces across various touch points became my daily
                        companion.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Out of this love for aesthetic design my passion for functionality and structure evolved.
                        Jumping right into Photoshop didn’t feel accurate anymore and skipping the steps of building a
                        framework based on functionality and usability became inevitable.
                    </p>

                <div class="about-section2-work2"> UX Design
                    <p>
                        A user-centered mindset and sensitivity for design turned out to be the perfect fit when
                        collaborating with agencies, clients and brands to develop digital concepts and solve problems
                        together.

                    <p>
                        This rough framework outlines my process of developing digital experiences:

                        <li><span>CREATE</span>
                            , evaluate and iterate deliverables like

                                <li>Personas</li>
                                <li>Site maps</li>
                                <li>Use cases and scenarios</li>
                                <li>User flow</li>

                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Communicating the conceptual approach/UX strategy and reasoning behind it, is present during the

                            A research and concept phase which referred to an existing brand strategy set the course at
                            the beginning of this project. General use cases based on personas, information architecture
                            and detailed wireframes for the whole digital appearance followed.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This appearance was structured into modules with a limited amount of additional
                            functionalities and supportive tools which build the framework for an engaging experience.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This approach provided a number of possibilities for the content team to setup unique pages
                            without forcing relevant and well elaborated content into steady templates.

                                Austria Tourism asked for very detailed wireframes for both desktop and mobile devices
                                to eliminate possible doubts at an early stage.

                                Especially the navigation concept which was tested with interactive click dummies was
                                quite a challenge because of the huge amount of content that should have been neatly
                                structured at this point.

                                this phase were kept short and crisp to allow multiple iteration cycles if needed.
